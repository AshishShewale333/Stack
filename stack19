A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if it meets one of the following:

It is an empty string "", or a single character not equal to "(" or ")",
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.
We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

depth("") = 0
depth(C) = 0, where C is a string with a single character not equal to "(" or ")".
depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's.
depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.
For example, "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.

Given a VPS represented as string s, return the nesting depth of s.

Example 1:

Input: s = "(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1" 
Output: 3
Explanation: Digit 8 is inside of 3 nested parentheses in the string.
Example 2:

Input: s = "(1)+((2))+(((3)))" 
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists of digits 0-9 and characters '+', '-', '*', '/', '(', and ')'.
It is guaranteed that parentheses expression s is a VPS.



✅ Java Code:

class MaxNestingDepth {
    public int maxDepth(String s) {
        int currentDepth = 0;
        int maxDepth = 0;

        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == '(') {
                currentDepth++;
                maxDepth = Math.max(maxDepth, currentDepth);
            } else if (ch == ')') {
                currentDepth--;
            }
        }

        return maxDepth;
    }

    // Sample usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaxNestingDepth md = new MaxNestingDepth();
        System.out.println(md.maxDepth("(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1")); // Output: 3
        System.out.println(md.maxDepth("(1)+((2))+(((3)))"));   // Output: 3
        System.out.println(md.maxDepth("1+2*3/4"));             // Output: 0 (no parentheses)
    }
}
💡 Explanation:
Iterate over the characters in the string:

( increases the current depth.

) decreases it.

Track the maximum depth reached during traversal.

🧠 Example:
Input: (1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1

Edit
Depth changes:
(  → 1
 (  → 2
  ((  → 3
  )) → 2, etc.
Max Depth = 3

⏱ Time & Space Complexity:
Time: O(n), where n is the length of the string

Space: O(1), constant space used
